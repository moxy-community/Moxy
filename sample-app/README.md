# Moxy Sample App

Hype-Driven Development in action!

The app features the [Astronomy Picture of the day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) in a mobile format.

Though it's just one screen, it showcases all the main features of Moxy:

* rotate the screen - the state is restored for you
* no boilerplate code to set up MVP classes for the screen

The sample app is a miniature model of a real-world production application. It has some arthitecture, a network client, DI, image loading - check it out and [ask a question](https://github.com/moxy-community/Moxy/issues) if we've missed something!
